Use all-lowercase commit messages without a tag prefix, e.g. "add feature for better vibin'".

Make the commits relatively small and decompose them on semantic and logical level. Keep the commit message short and simple. Don't use commit descriptions.

Formatting related changes should be grouped into one commit.
